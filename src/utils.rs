//! Utility functions for file I/O operations in the SGPE simulation.
//!
//! This module provides functions for writing various types of data to files,
//! including potential energy, wave function data, coordinates, and simulation parameters.
//! These functions save the simulation results and allowing for
//! post-processing and analysis.
